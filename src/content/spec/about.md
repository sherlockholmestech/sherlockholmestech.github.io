# About

Hello! Im Sherlock, an average programmer that enjoys CTFs as a side quest.

You can also find me lurking in the Model United Nations circuit occasionally.

I primarily program in Rust, though I have dipped my toes (maybe a bit too much) into web development, especially in WeChat Mini Programs.
