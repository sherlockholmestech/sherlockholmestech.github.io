# Research Methodology

## Identify Keywords/Principles

- Must know where to start looking
- Jumpstart with the following questions:
    - What is the issue about?
    - Where did the issue begin?
    - When did the issue begin?
    - Who does the issue involve?
    - Why is this issue detrimental?
    - How can we resolve the issue?

## Wikipedia Ballpark

- Can be used for overview/general belief of the issue
    - Most of the keywords that u need can be found on the first paragraph of the Wikipedia entry
    - If you delve deeper, u  glean more info
- Used as starting point for research
    - Timelines, description of people involved, etc.
    - Footnotes

## Formal Research

- Sources should be established, official or academic, e.g.
    - Academic writing (Journal and Research Papers)
    - Newspapers (especially local to the context)
        - Idea of how news is presented internally
        - Google Translate if need be
    - Official government reports/UN reports

## Academic Sources

- Wikipedia and news sites can give you names of academics and sources
- Domains:
    - JStor - Academic journals
    - Taylor and Francis - Free stuff
    - SIPRI - Military Stuff
    - RAND
    - ScienceDirect
    - Nature

### Optimal Reading

- Abstract
- Introduction
- Results
- Discussion
- Evaluate what you have read
    - Strength of supporting arguments
    - Legitimacy
    - Rationality of analysis and fallacies
- Corroboration and Comparison
    - Facts may be misrepresented
        - Biases
        - Inaccuracies
    - To fact-check and avoid bias:
        - Pick a different, more established source
            - Different media outlets
        - Compare across multiple different sources
- Bias
    - All sources have biases in different degrees
        - Political interests
        - Economic pressures
        - Reporter biases
        - Cultural and societal factors
        - Confirmation bias
- Biases present themselves in different ways:
    - Selective reporting and omission of context
    - Language and framing
    - Source selection

### Consolidating and Integrating

- Finalise findings, support with evidence
    - Build solutions around this evidence, but avoid over-focusing
- Ensure that suggested solutions are cohesive with our approach to the topic
    - As a belligerent country, maintain hardline stance
    - As neutral country, ur flexible to suggest more
- Ensure links made between Scope of Debate and Topic

# Understanding Stance

- Country’s official position on an issue
- Stance is dynamic
- Country’s stance is derived from
    - History
        - What shaped the country
        - What was the country’s historical position on the issue
    - Geography
        - Where is the country
        - What geographical resources does it have
        - What geographical resources could it seek to gain
    - Philosophy and guiding principles
        - What are the country’s official principles
        - What international principles does the country adhere to
    - Political and Economic Leanings
        - What political system does the country subscribe to
        - What economic system does the country subscribe to

## Researching Stance

- Tweak research process to identify stance
- Understand the development of the issue
- search for reactions and relationships
- Read government statements and reports
    - Government websites
    - Government mouthpiece newspapers
- Identify previous actions on similar issues
- Look at the leanings of the country

## International Relations

- Realism
    - States are selfish
- Liberalism
    - States can cooperate
- Constructivism
    - States can cooperate to achieve goals

Stance is ultimately a mix of potential gains, relations with other actors and principles.

# Position Paper Writing

- Condensation of
    - Context
    - Stance
    - Potential solutions
- Introduce the problem as your country experiences it
    - How are stakeholders (children) affected
- Impacts of issue
- Explicitly present your country stance on the issue
    - CLEAR AND DELIBERATE
    - DO NOT DEFAME YOUR COUNTRY
- Mention existing solution
- Name some allies and opponents
- Propose one or two key solutions
    - Solutions should align with your country’s positiong
        - Has your country proposed this in real life
        - Potential gains
        - Evaluate
- Call to Action
    - Direct a call to action to the committee

## Other Criteria

- Language and Professionalism
    - Appropriate lexical choices
    - Language must be formal
    - Good command of grammar
    - Good, clear sentence structure

# Lobbying and Negotiations

## Macro Lobbying

- Start lobbying from your very first speech
- Use call to actions to encourage other delegates to approach you and work with you
- Showcase your content knowledge and charisma
- Confidence
    - Speak loudly and clearly
    - Stand up straight
    - Use hand gestures to illustrate your point
    - Establish eye contact with audience
    - Ok to write your speech down and read off a script
- Engagement
    - Engage with other delegates
- Yeild
    - To POI
    - To another delegate
- Unmoderated Caucuses
    - Address council as a whole and engage  with other delegates

## Micro Lobbying

- Delegates communicate via notepassing
- Use notes to identify potential ally
- Use UNMOD to call for negos or bloc meetings

# Key Misconceptions
## Compromise
 - Compromise ≠ Moving stance towards the centre
 - Compromise is finding overlaps with 2 positions
 - Even if something is not ideal, if it is acceptable to both parties, compromise may very well be in order.
